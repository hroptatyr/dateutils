See info page examples and/or README.

v0.2.0
------
Summary: v0.2.0 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.2.0.

This is a feature release.

The distinction between binaries for date, time and date-time processing
is cleared up by a unified set of tools, prefixed with `d`.

Thus:
dadd + tadd -> dadd
dconv + tconv + dtconv -> dconv
ddiff + tdiff -> ddiff
dgrep + tgrep -> dgrep
dseq + tseq -> dseq
dtest + ttest -> dtest

Furthermore, all tools now fully cope with dates, times and date-times.
Virtual timezones have been added (use `GPS` or `TAI`).

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.10
-------
Summary: v0.1.10 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.10.

This is a bug fix release.

- account for big-endian machines
- GNUisms (mempcpy() and getline()) are removed
- inf-loop in tseq is fixed (bug #6)
- nanoseconds are preserved upon time zone conversion

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.9
------
Summary: v0.1.9 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.9.

This is a bug fix release.

The code for date addition is refactored, with it a new duration type is
introduced, DT_MD, to capture larger month and day summands.

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.8
------
Summary: v0.1.8 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.8.

This is a bug fix release.

A bit fiddling bug gave erroneous results in `dconv now`.

Furtherly, date expressions (for dgrep et al.) can now be arbitrarily
joined with conjunctions (&&) and disjunctions (||) as well as negations
(!).

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.7
------
Summary: v0.1.7 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.7.

This is a bug fix release.

Most notably, sloppy date arithmetics have been replaced by correct
ones, e.g. 2100 is not longer a leap year and the 31st of Feb is
instantly corrected to 28/29 Feb.

Furtherly, the unmaintainable idea of dedicated duration types has been
replaced with overloaded dt_d_s types with the side-effect that
adding days or business days to dates now works and ymcw dates can be
properly compared.

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.6
------
Summary: v0.1.6 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.6.

This is a feature release.

The dcal and tcal binaries are renamed to dconv and tconv respectively,
there has been a naming conflict with the tcal binary from the gcal
package.  Thanks to ulm (https://github.com/ulm) for pointing this out.

Changes in behaviour:
Furthermore, many numerical specifiers now cope with the `th` flag to
denote ordinals: `%dth %b %Y` applied to 2011-10-03 will yield
`3rd Oct 2011`.

business days can be denoted by suffixing them with `b` both in the
input and the specs, the `b` modifer like the `th` modifier are
suffixes and serve formatting and notation purposes.

Also, many gnu-isms are removed to facilitate \*BSD builds.

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.5
------
Summary: v0.1.5 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.5.

This is a feature release.
Grep-like utilities have been added.

+ dgrep  like grep for date values
+ tgrep  like grep for time values
+ ttest  like test for time values
+ tcal   like dcal for time values

Changed behaviour:
Utilities in sed-mode will repeat the whole line if nothing on the line
matches instead of writing a warning.

See info page examples and/or README.

v0.1.4
------
Summary: v0.1.4 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.4.

This is a feature release.
Utilities to deal with times have been added.

+ tseq  like dseq for time values
+ tadd  like dadd for time values
+ tdiff like ddiff for time values

See info page examples and/or README.

Man pages have an author now and most of the format specs are
documented, at least the specs we do not plan to change.

v0.1.3
------
Summary: release v0.1.3 of dateutils

This is dateutils v0.1.3.

This is a feature and convenience release.
Most importantly, the project is now called `dateutils`.
All tools are documented now (to some degree) and have their own tests.

v0.1.2
------
Summary: release v0.1.2 of datetools

This is datetools v0.1.2.

This is a feature release.  The dseq tool is now entirely in the hand of
our internal date library.  Furthermore, dseq now accepts negative
increments and dates where FIRST > LAST.  Hereby the increment argument
has an overloaded meaning:
If INCREMENT is negative but FIRST < LAST then compute the beginning
instead of the end.

    dseq 2000-01-01 -34 2000-03-31
    =>
      2000-01-23
      2000-02-26
      2000-03-31

as opposed to

    dseq 2000-01-01 34 2000-03-31
    =>
      2000-01-01
      2000-02-04
      2000-03-09

Likewise, FIRST can be newer than LAST and with a negative increment,
the end is variable whereas a positive increment leaves the beginning
variable.

v0.1.1
------
Summary: release v0.1.1 of datetools

This is datetools v0.1.1.

This is a clean up release with the long-term aim to outsource all
functionality into a library.  Two new command line tools have undergone
this transition, dcal and dtest.

The overall goal is to have all tools using a common set of command line
options, -i or --input-format to specify one or more input formats to be
tried and -f or --format to specify an output format if applicable.

v0.1.0
------
Summary: release v0.1.0 of datetools

This is datetools v0.1.0.

This is the first working version of datetools comprising two command
line tools, dseq and strptime.
